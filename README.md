 My first Project @ programming advices academy using functional progarmming
 
 Basically it a consol application for a bank system, showing Users and Clients
 app check login info for each User (in this case users are employes at the bank)   
 The good thing about this project is that you get all basics of C++ language using struct, enums and function calls
 Also you learn how divide and conquer concept is very important in programming
